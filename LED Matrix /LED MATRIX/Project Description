his project involves designing and building an 8-LED matrix controlled by an Arduino Uno and a 74HC595 shift register. 
The goal is to create a simple but effective system to control multiple LEDs using minimal I/O pins on the Arduino. T
This project is perfect for learning about shift registers, LED control, and basic electronics principles.
